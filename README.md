### Why botland?

I'm slowly creating a series of bots that do "fun things". Currently I just have:
- Twitter's hottest new bot, the [@cantobot](https://twitter.com/cantobot), which posts a canto from Dante's inferno every day.
- [What's JWST up to?](http://michaelramsay.com/whats-jwst-up-to) gives a simple view of what JWST is doing - pics and observation proposals included.
