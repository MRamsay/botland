<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<section>
	<ul>
  	<li>300 ml water</li>
  	<li>1 tbsp yeast</li>
  	<li>3.5 cup (500g) all-purpose flour</li>
  	<li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
  	<li>2 tsp salt</li>
  	<li>1.5 tbsp lard or tallow</li>
	</ul>

	Alternately, double the recipe but with 7 tsb salt and half/half all-purpose and whole wheat flour for nice artisanal loaves. This still yields 2 loaves but of larger size.

<p>Accidentally didn't remove the boiling pot of water but bread turned out good anyway. You can also just toss some water into the bottom of the oven at the start.</p>
