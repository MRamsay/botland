  His mouth uplifting from the savage feast,
    The sinner[829] rubbed and wiped it free of gore
    On the hair of the head he from behind laid waste;
  And then began: 'Thou'dst have me wake once more
    A desperate grief, of which to think alone,
    Ere I have spoken, wrings me to the core.
  But if my words shall be as seed that sown
    May fructify unto the traitor's shame
    Whom thus I gnaw, I mingle speech[830] and groan.
  Of how thou earnest hither or thy name                            10
    I nothing know, but that a Florentine[831]
    In very sooth thou art, thy words proclaim.
  Thou then must know I was Count Ugolin,
    The Archbishop Roger[832] he. Now hearken well
    Why I prove such a neighbour. How in fine,
  And flowing from his ill designs, it fell
    That I, confiding in his words, was caught
    Then done to death, were waste of time[833] to tell.
  But that of which as yet thou heardest nought
    Is how the death was cruel which I met:                         20
    Hearken and judge if wrong to me he wrought.
  Scant window in the mew whose epithet
    Of Famine[834] came from me its resident,
    And cooped in which shall many languish yet,
  Had shown me through its slit how there were spent
    Full many moons,[835] ere that bad dream I dreamed
    When of my future was the curtain rent.
  Lord of the hunt and master this one seemed,
    Chasing the wolf and wolf-cubs on the height[836]
    By which from Pisan eyes is Lucca hemmed.                       30
  With famished hounds well trained and swift of flight,
    Lanfranchi[837] and Gualandi in the van,
    And Sismond he had set. Within my sight
  Both sire and sons--nor long the chase--began
    To grow (so seemed it) weary as they fled;
    Then through their flanks fangs sharp and eager ran.
  When I awoke before the morning spread
    I heard my sons[838] all weeping in their sleep--
    For they were with me--and they asked for bread.
  Ah! cruel if thou canst from pity keep                            40
    At the bare thought of what my heart foreknew;
    And if thou weep'st not, what could make thee weep?
  Now were they 'wake, and near the moment drew
    At which 'twas used to bring us our repast;
    But each was fearful[839] lest his dream came true.
  And then I heard the under gate[840] made fast
    Of the horrible tower, and thereupon I gazed
    In my sons' faces, silent and aghast.
  I did not weep, for I to stone was dazed:
    They wept, and darling Anselm me besought:                      50
    "What ails thee, father? Wherefore thus amazed?"
  And yet I did not weep, and answered not
    The whole day, and that night made answer none,
    Till on the world another sun shone out.
  Soon as a feeble ray of light had won
    Into our doleful prison, made aware
    Of the four faces[841] featured like my own,
  Both of my hands I bit at in despair;
    And they, imagining that I was fain
    To eat, arose before me with the prayer:                        60
  "O father, 'twere for us an easier pain
    If thou wouldst eat us. Thou didst us array
    In this poor flesh: unclothe us now again."
  I calmed me, not to swell their woe. That day
    And the next day no single word we said.
    Ah! pitiless earth, that didst unyawning stay!
  When we had reached the fourth day, Gaddo, spread
    Out at my feet, fell prone; and made demand:
    "Why, O my father, offering us no aid?"
  There died he. Plain as I before thee stand                       70
    I saw the three as one by one they failed,
    The fifth day and the sixth; then with my hand,
  Blind now, I groped for each of them, and wailed
    On them for two days after they were gone.
    Famine[842] at last, more strong than grief, prevailed,'
  When he had uttered this, his eyes all thrown
    Awry, upon the hapless skull he fell
    With teeth that, dog-like, rasped upon the bone.
  Ah, Pisa! byword of the folk that dwell
    In the sweet country where the Si[843] doth sound,              80
    Since slow thy neighbours to reward thee well
  Let now Gorgona and Capraia[844] mound
    Themselves where Arno with the sea is blent,
    Till every one within thy walls be drowned.
  For though report of Ugolino went
    That he betrayed[845] thy castles, thou didst wrong
    Thus cruelly his children to torment.
  These were not guilty, for they were but young,
    Thou modern Thebes![846] Brigata and young Hugh,
    And the other twain of whom above 'tis sung.                    90
  We onward passed to where another crew[847]
    Of shades the thick-ribbed ice doth fettered keep;
    Their heads not downward these, but backward threw.
  Their very weeping will not let them weep,
    And grief, encountering barriers at their eyes,
    Swells, flowing inward, their affliction deep;
  For the first tears that issue crystallise,
    And fill, like vizor fashioned out of glass,
    The hollow cup o'er which the eyebrows rise.
  And though, as 'twere a callus, now my face                      100
    By reason of the frost was wholly grown
    Benumbed and dead to feeling, I could trace
  (So it appeared), a breeze against it blown,
    And asked: 'O Master, whence comes this? So low
    As where we are is any vapour[848] known?'
  And he replied: 'Thou ere long while shalt go
    Where touching this thine eye shall answer true,
    Discovering that which makes the wind to blow.'
  Then from the cold crust one of that sad crew
    Demanded loud: 'Spirits, for whom they hold                    110
    The inmost room, so truculent were you,
  Back from my face let these hard veils be rolled,
    That I may vent the woe which chokes my heart,
    Ere tears again solidify with cold.'
  And I to him: 'First tell me who thou art
    If thou'dst have help; then if I help not quick
    To the bottom[849] of the ice let me depart.'
  He answered: 'I am Friar Alberic[850]--
    He of the fruit grown in the orchard fell--
    And here am I repaid with date for fig.'                       120
  'Ah!' said I to him, 'art thou dead as well?'
    'How now my body fares,' he answered me,
    'Up in the world, I have no skill to tell;
  For Ptolom√¶a[851] has this quality--
    The soul oft plunges hither to its place
    Ere it has been by Atropos[852] set free.
  And that more willingly from off my face
    Thou mayst remove the glassy tears, know, soon
    As ever any soul of man betrays
  As I betrayed, the body once his own                             130
    A demon takes and governs until all
    The span allotted for his life be run.
  Into this tank headlong the soul doth fall;
    And on the earth his body yet may show
    Whose shade behind me wintry frosts enthral.
  But thou canst tell, if newly come below:
    It is Ser Branca d'Oria,[853] and complete
    Is many a year since he was fettered so.'
  'It seems,' I answered, 'that thou wouldst me cheat,
    For Branca d'Oria never can have died:                         140
    He sleeps, puts clothes on, swallows drink and meat.'
  'Or e'er to the tenacious pitchy tide
    Which boils in Malebranche's moat had come
    The shade of Michael Zanche,' he replied,
  'That soul had left a devil in its room
    Within its body; of his kinsmen one[854]
    Treacherous with him experienced equal doom.
  But stretch thy hand and be its work begun
    Of setting free mine eyes.' This did not I.
    Twas highest courtesy to yield him none.[855]                  150
  Ah, Genoese,[856] strange to morality!
    Ye men infected with all sorts of sin!
    Out of the world 'tis time that ye should die.
  Here, to Romagna's blackest soul[857] akin,
    I chanced on one of you; for doing ill
    His soul o'erwhelmed Cocytus' floods within,
  Though in the flesh he seems surviving still.
